 <h2>Why I decided University in the USA</h2>
     <p>Actually, University in Japan is so easy to graduation. However, entry to university is very difficult. We study a lot for entry test.
	 So, almost everyone doesnâ€™t make an effort on study after admission. That's why I chose university in the USA. I don't want to waste my four years. <br>
	 To be able to speak English is a huge advantage in Japan because the Grammer between Japan and the USA has huge difference than other language.
	 For example, we don' need Subject in Japanese sentence, so it's difficult to speak English to Japanese.
	 So, I want to get enough English skills in the USA.</p>

<h2>My Motto</h2>
    <p>My motto is<i>"a little change makes mircle them, turn dreams into reality"</i>
    This word was said by my respected teacher. I don't want to afraid to change something. 
	It's up to me about after to change something, but I can make an effort. So, in order to dream come true, I wish to be fearless about to change.
